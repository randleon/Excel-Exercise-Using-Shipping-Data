## Shipping Excel Exersise


In order to get some insight into your Excel skills, we would like you to demostrate how you would solve the problem described below.

We have created a dataset with dummy-values very similar to the data we receive from some of our customers. This file contains an example of a dataset -  two tabs with different information. The tab named "Sea Freight Rates" includes a simplified and structured set of fictive sea freight rates (One rate per tradelane and equipment type). The tab named "Volume" shows the volume this customer ships.

We would like you to allocate the volume to the appropriate sea freight rate by linking the information provided in the "Volume"-tab to the corresponding sea freight rate in the "Sea Freight Rates"-tab.

Allocating the volumes manually is possible, but extremely time consuming. We therefore challenge you to perform this task by using various formulas and functions available in Excel. 
Please make sure we understand the steps you have taken by leaving any work-tab, formula or additional column you have made in the file. 
If you feel that documenting your process is worthwile - please do that. Also, please let us know how long it took you to complete the task.
